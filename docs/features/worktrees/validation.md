## Validation so far

You are implementing the Git Worktrees feature for CC Insights, a Flutter desktop app for monitoring Claude Code agents.

### Context

**Project Location:** `/tmp/cc-insights/project`

**Key Documentation:**
- Feature Plan: `docs/features/worktrees/plan.md`
- Task List: `docs/features/worktrees/tasks.md`
- Project Guide: `CLAUDE.md`
- Testing Guide: `flutter_app/TESTS.md` - **READ THIS** for test patterns and mocking infrastructure

**Architecture:**
- Flutter app (`flutter_app/`) with Provider state management
- Dart SDK (`dart_sdk/`) wraps Node.js backend
- Configuration patterns in `flutter_app/lib/services/runtime_config.dart`

## Your Mission 

1. **Read the tasks list**: Go through the tasks.md file and look at each of the marked completed tasks
2. **Verify task completion**: Check the task is completed as required. Do not assume just because there are some files there that it has all been implemented. 
3. **Test validation**: Do not run the tests, but check that they are testing what they are supposed to test.

## When you are done

Report back which tasks have issues, and what the issues are. 

## Important Rules

- DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FIX ANYTHING
- DO NOT CHANGE tasks.md
